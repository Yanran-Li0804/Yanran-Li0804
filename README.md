## Featured Projects 🌱

### 1. [Wolt Data Analyst Pre-task (EDA)](https://github.com/Yanran-Li0804/wolt-user-purchase-analysis)  May 2025  
Analyzed synthetic user data from a Wolt-like delivery service to examine how the timing of a user’s first purchase impacts long-term behavior.

Defined two custom metrics:
- Early Purchase Timing (Day 1 / Week 1 / Within 14 Days)
- Purchase Frequency = Total Purchases ÷ Days Since Registration

**📌 Key Insights**:
- Almost all high-frequency users made their first purchase within Week 1  
- T-tests & regressions show Week 1 purchases are highly predictive of long-term usage, more so than Week 2 or 14-day purchases  
- Users who bought during Week 1 have the highest average purchase frequency  
- Week 2 purchases are not predictive of future engagement  

**🎯 Recommendation**:
Keep the 14-day free delivery incentive, but add an extra reward for Week 1 purchases (e.g., lottery or repeat-order bonus)  
→ Goal: reinforce early habits & maximize customer lifetime value

**🛠️ Skills**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, T-test, OLS Regression
